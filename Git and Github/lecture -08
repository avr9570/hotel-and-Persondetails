Git & GitHub
Git is like a time machine for your code.
It is a tool that keeps a record of every version of your code, so you can always go back to a previous state if something goes wrong.
Install Git: If you haven't already, download and install Git on your computer. You can get it from the official Git website
If you want to work with git in your projectâ†’
Run git init inside the root folder of your project
This command tells Git to start tracking changes in your project folder.turns all files to green. it means it is watching all the folder and taking a look ki what changes are being done what file id added but not commiting it. its like adding tracker to all the folder
git status

git status - tells the staus of the codde, if it is commited or not. if some folder appears red means those are untacked folders not added to the git. not saved to it,
After making changes to your project (e.g., writing code), you'll want to save those changes in Git.
git add
The means "add all changes." You can replace it with specific file names with the '.'
git keeps the snapsshots of every version of code to the root directory
we never save node modules becoz it has high storage also it the files we req locally to run code but it is automatically managed by npm we dont neeed to save it. we dont track it ki ham usmai kya changes karre hai. we dont change it. so git ignore such folder

GIT IGNORE
gitignore
The.gitignore file is a special configuration file used in Git repositories to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
These ignored files and directories won't be tracked by Git or included in version control.
Create.gitignore File
#Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/
#other entries

~ this savea a snapshot of your project's current state.
git commit -m "initial commit"

~to remove node_modules after adding it to git add. is = git rm -r --cached node_modules
-------------------------------------------------
If you want to collaborate with others or back up your code online, or save this local code online you can create a remote repository on platforms like GitHub
Link Your Local and Remote Repositories
If you created a remote repository, you can link it to your local one
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hotels.git
Push Changes to Remote
To send your local commits to the remote repository, use the git push command, bcoz evern after commiting the code it get commited to the local git but does not get updated at repo. so use git push to that commit in repo also
git push -u origin master.
THIS CODE LOCALLY CAN BE PUSHED ON REMOTE REPO CONTINUSOUSLY 
PULL CHANGES
if you are collaborating with others you can fetch their changes and merge them into your code using git pull.

HOST MONGODB DATABASE   :
Now we are running locally MongoDB database. we are talking about db.js file
All data operation is performed in a local database, so let's host our database server and make our DB online presence so that data stored in db can also be accessed online
MongoDB Atlas provides a Free cluster for users where you can host your database for free.
MongoDB Atlas offers a cloud-based platform for hosting MongoDB databases
The free tier allows developers to explore and experiment with the database without incurring any costs.
LIKE WE HAVE A LOCAL SERVER OF DATABSE SO WE ARE ACCESSING DATA LOCALLY BY GOING IN MONGODB COMPASS. SO SETUP A ONLINE SERVER OF DATABSE TO ACCESSS DATA ONLINE. db.js is the local sever of the database and it has a mongourl, replace it by online server link then good to go
